## The Challenge

Mental health crises affect millions, yet reaching out for help remains one of the most difficult steps for those in need. Traditional support systems often require individuals to articulate their struggles when they're least able to do so, creating a critical gap in mental health care.

The founders, having lived experience with mental health challenges, identified key barriers:
- Difficulty expressing emotions during crisis moments
- Fear of judgment when reaching out for help
- Lack of easy connection to trusted support networks
- Limited accessibility to mental health resources
- Need for proactive check-in systems for ongoing support
