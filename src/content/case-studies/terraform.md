## The Challenge

Go West Tours, a leading Australian tourism operator, faced a persistent operational bottleneck: their reservations team was spending a substantial amount of time manually correcting tour departure (pickup) details for bookings made via third-party agents.

Although these agents had direct API integrations with FareHarbor, the data received by guests was often inaccurate or incomplete. This resulted in thousands of bookings per year requiring hands-on intervention — all managed manually through email and spreadsheets.

This manual burden not only strained their reservations team but introduced the risk of human error and impacted the guest experience.

## The Solution: TerraForm

We partnered with Go West Tours to design and build TerraForm, a bespoke automation platform built to bridge the data gap between agent bookings and FareHarbor.

### Key Features of TerraForm:

- 🧠 **Booking Data Monitoring:** Automatically scans incoming bookings from third-party agents via FareHarbor.

- 🔁 **Automated Corrections:** Applies business rules to detect incorrect or missing information and updates bookings accordingly.

- 🌐 **Web-Based Dashboard:** Allows Go West staff to view and audit automation history, status, and changes in real time.

- 🗺️ **Custom Mapping Engine:** Translates inconsistent data formats (e.g., pickup location codes or descriptions) into Go West's internal standards before writing back to FareHarbor.

## The Results

Within weeks of deployment, TerraForm eliminated the need for manual intervention across thousands of bookings annually — unlocking:

- ✅ **Time savings:** Staff hours previously spent on repetitive corrections were redirected to high-value tasks.

- ✅ **Cost reductions:** A measurable decrease in operational overhead within the reservations team.

- ✅ **Improved guest experience:** Guests now receive timely, accurate pickup details without delay or confusion.

## Could Automation Save Your Team Hours Each Week?

If your business is manually cleaning up booking data, cross-checking information between systems, or constantly "fixing things" your platforms should do automatically — you're not alone.
