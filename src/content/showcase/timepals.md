# Supporting children's time management and routine understanding

TimePals was developed to address the specific needs of children with autism spectrum disorder and other developmental challenges who struggle with time comprehension and task management. Created initially for a daughter with autism level 2, the application transforms abstract concepts of time into visual, interactive experiences.

The platform helps children build independence and confidence in managing their daily activities through structured visual scheduling and real-time feedback.

## Impact and Research Potential

TimePals has garnered significant interest from child psychologists working in autism research, with investigations underway to incorporate the application into formal medical research studies. The app's approach to visualizing time and routine management shows promise for supporting therapeutic interventions and improving quality of life for neurodivergent children.
