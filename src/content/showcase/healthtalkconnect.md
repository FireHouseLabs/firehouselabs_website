# Technology supported rehabilitation

Aphasia affects how safe patients are in hospital and how they communicate with their healthcare teams. Stroke patients with aphasia are more likely to experience preventable adverse events while in hospital. Technology offers a solution. We collaborated with individuals with aphasia, their family and healthcare workers to develop the Aphasia App:  a new mHealth intervention tailored to support effective healthcare communication.

The app accompanies the patient throughout transitions in their healthcare aiming to close potential communication gaps and improve patient safety and satisfaction.

The usability of the beta version are currently being tested in an observational study with stroke patients and staff  in acute and rehabilitation wards. The next step is a  study of its effect on healthcare communication under controlled conditions.

Project aims
To discover facilitators and barriers to implementation of the Aphasia App in acute stroke and rehabilitation settings and to determine its effects on healthcare communication.
