# Built from experience

RespondReady was developed with the intent of replacing paper based field guides and disorganised online information to ensure first responders always have relevant, accurate and up-to-date information when responding to emergency situations.

The platform features a fully featured administrator web app that allows curation and maintenance of all content contained within the app.

The emergency responder mobile app is designed to work offline, allows contemperanious notes and images to be taken at the incident scene.

RespondReady may also be deployed with our emergency first responder AI platform, EMBER AI.
