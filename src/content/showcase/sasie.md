# Extending functionality of response-critical application

The SAS Turnout screen is designed to provide brigades with information for emergency events. The remainder of time, the dashboard is ineffective and often shows no information. SASIE adds additional elements to the SAS turnout screen including upcoming brigade events, news, weather and time.

SAS is often displayed via a browser, which requires refresh timers and various other tooling to ensure the dashboard remains on display. All these features are now built into a single application.

The SASIE app is cross platform and designed to run on Windows, Mac and Linux.
